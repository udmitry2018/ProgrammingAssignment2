#The function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to

#set the value of the vector
#get the value of the vector
#set the value of the mean
#get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x

  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


# The following function returns the inverse of the matrix. It first checks if
# the inverse has already been computed. If so, it gets the result and skips the
# computation. If not, it computes the inverse, sets the value in the cache via
# setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
